## This project is a joke

A friend bet with me if i could create a personal assistant who searched wikipedia in 15 minutes.

# The assistant should:
    - Know the name of the person who speaks to her
    - Reply in audio
    - Search for wikipedia terms
    - Tell jokes (**that was an increase on my part**)
